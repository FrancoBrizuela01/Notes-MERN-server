# Notes-MERN-server
Test Ensolvers

This web application was created for #Ensolvers in a challenge for an interview process

Requirements:

Have installed:

MongoDBcompass version 1.31.2 NodeJS version 12.3.1

To start the project you have to run bash init.sh: ./init.sh

To enter from the browser you have to access: localhost:3000

The dependencies used were:

{ "name": "mernnoteserver", "version": "1.0.0", "description": "MERN API for Ensolvers", "main": "index.js", "scripts": { "start": "node .", "dev": "nodemon ." }, "author": "Franco Brizuela", "license": "ISC", "devDependencies": { "nodemon": "^2.0.16" }, "dependencies": { "cors": "^2.8.5", "dotenv": "^16.0.0", "express": "^4.18.1", "express-validator": "^6.14.0", "mongoose": "^6.3.3" } }

In case there are conflicts in the installation of dependencies, the following were done:

client: npx create-react-app npm i react-transition-group npm i axios npm i sweetalert2

server: npm init npm i -D nodemon npm i express mongoose dotenv npm i express-validator npm i cors

In the design I used BOOTSTRAP v5.1 and CSS for alerts use SweetAlert2
